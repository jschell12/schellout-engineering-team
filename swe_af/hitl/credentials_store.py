"""Process-local, execution-scoped store for credentials the scout negotiates.

Why a module-level dict instead of ``BuildConfig`` or ``app.memory``:

* ``BuildConfig`` is serialized through ``to_execution_config_dict()`` and
  passed to ``execute()`` via ``app.call``. The control plane logs all
  ``app.call`` input data, which would persist the credentials.
* ``app.memory`` (scope=``run``) is synced to the control plane DB by design
  — also persists.
* Filesystem under ``artifacts_dir`` is written to disk and archived.

The scout's negotiation produces credentials that should *only* live in the
agent process's memory for the duration of the build, then be cleared. A
module-level dict keyed by execution_id is the simplest way to achieve that
while keeping concurrent builds (which share the Python process) isolated.

Security boundary:

* Values are never logged.
* Values are never written to disk.
* Values are not serialized through ``app.call`` (use this store from inside
  the receiving reasoner, not as a kwarg).
* The build()'s ``finally`` block MUST call ``clear_scoped_credentials`` —
  every error path included.
